# Main.py Refactoring Notes

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- Created a `Config` class to centralize all configuration settings
- Manages file paths, output directories, and environment variables
- Automatically creates output directories if they don't exist
- Provides helper methods for generating file paths

### 2. Model Processing (`model_processor.py`)
- Extracted all model processing logic into a dedicated `ModelProcessor` class
- Separated HuggingFace and GitHub processing into distinct methods
- Improved error handling with proper logging
- Returns boolean success/failure indicators

### 3. Simplified Main (`main.py`)
- Reduced from 124 lines to 98 lines (21% reduction)
- Focused on orchestration only
- Added proper logging configuration
- Improved error tracking with success/failure counters
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each class has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Logic is now in separate classes that can be unit tested
3. **Configurability**: All settings centralized in one place
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent logging and error reporting
5. **Readability**: Main function is now much cleaner and easier to follow

## Usage

The application works exactly the same way as before:

```bash
python main.py
```

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility while providing a much cleaner architecture.
